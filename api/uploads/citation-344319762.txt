Jain, Rahul & Sharma, Mrs. (2020). IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF INTERCLOUD LOAD BALANCING USING DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH FOR VERTICAL SCALING. 10.21276/24565644. Scaling of resource in IT infrastructure is major issue, due to live tracking of load on internet traffic. The process of scaling of resource creates the concept of elastic load balancing in cloud computing. The elastic load balancing proceeds the task of intercloud load balancing. The intercloud load balancing methods improve the efficiency of dedicated cloud network and reduces the traffic load of user for the process of user provisioning. The proposed algorithms work in fashion of coupling of virtual machine. The coupling of virtual machine reduces the traffic density of service during the multi-platform resource sharing. The proposed algorithm simulated in Cloud simulator. The cloud simulator encapsulates with the algorithm of intercloud load balancing and DAG trigging process. The measurement of performance used the load of data in terms of processing times and data center. The variation of load and traffic increase the performance of proposed algorithm for allocation of resource. The efficiency of cloud network increase to 5-10%.
